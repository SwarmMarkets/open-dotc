# Use Cases

## 1. Direct Asset Swaps

    Scenario:
    	Two parties, Alice and Bob, want to trade digital assets directly without intermediaries. Alice has ERC20 tokens she wants to exchange for an ERC721 collectible owned by Bob.
    Use Case:
    	Alice creates an offer on the platform, depositing her ERC20 tokens into escrow. Bob reviews the offer, and if the terms are agreeable, he accepts the offer, transferring his ERC721 token to Alice through the escrow service, which simultaneously releases Alice's ERC20 tokens to him.

## 2. Cross-Platform Trading

    Scenario:
    	A gaming company wants to allow users to trade in-game items (represented as ERC1155 tokens) for cryptocurrency.
    Use Case:
    	The company uses the platform to facilitate trades where users can list their in-game items in exchange for cryptocurrency. The escrow system ensures that the items are only transferred if the cryptocurrency payment is confirmed, protecting both parties.

## 3. Wholesale Trades

    Scenario:
    	A cryptocurrency exchange wants to provide a platform for users to make large, wholesale transactions that might be too disruptive if performed on the open market.
    Use Case:
    	Traders use the OTC platform to make large trades directly with each other, minimizing market impact and ensuring price stability for large volume transactions. The platform's ability to handle partial offers allows for flexibility in fulfilling large orders over time.

## 4. Liquidity Provision

    Scenario:
    	An investor with a significant amount of a particular token wants to provide liquidity without affecting the market price drastically.
    Use Case:
    	The investor can list an offer on the OTC platform, specifying a window during which the offer is valid and the conditions under which it can be accepted. This allows smaller traders to purchase portions of the total offering at a stable price, facilitated by the timelock and escrow features.

## 5. Custom and Conditional Offers

    Scenario:
    	A venture capital firm wants to sell a portion of its holdings in a startupâ€™s token but only to accredited investors.
    Use Case:
    	The firm uses the platform to create offers that can only be accepted by addresses that have been pre-approved and meet specific criteria (e.g., special addresses). This ensures compliance with regulatory requirements while still leveraging the benefits of decentralized trading.

## 6. Arbitrage Opportunities

    Scenario:
    	A trader identifies a price discrepancy between tokens on different blockchains or platforms.
    Use Case:
    	The trader uses the OTC platform to quickly set up trades to exploit arbitrage opportunities across different tokens or derivatives, using the secure and fast settlement of the platform to capitalize on temporary price differences.

## 7. Hedging and Derivatives

    Scenario:
    	A miner or a large holder of a cryptocurrency wants to hedge against price volatility.
    Use Case:
    	They can use the platform to enter into OTC derivatives contracts, such as forwards or options, tailored to their risk exposure. These contracts are settled and managed through the platform, providing a secure environment for complex financial transactions.

## 8. Decentralized Finance (DeFi) Integrations

    Scenario:
    	DeFi platforms want to offer users the ability to trade assets or collateral directly from their wallets in a decentralized manner.
    Use Case:
    	The OTC platform can be integrated into existing DeFi applications to provide an additional layer of trading functionality, expanding the services available to DeFi users without compromising on decentralization or security.
